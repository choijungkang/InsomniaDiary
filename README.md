In modern society, digital healthcare that can restore sleep quality has become possible thanks to the items described below.
Advances in Scientific Research: Sleep analysis through brainwaves has made significant strides in the field of sleep research in recent decades, and it plays an important role in understanding and improving individual sleep patterns.
The Importance of Personalized Health Care: Personalized Health Care is being emphasized. Therefore, an application is needed to measure brain waves and provide advice accordingly to tell you which type of sleep pattern is most ideal for an individual. 
Technology Innovation and Utilization: Technology innovation allows users to easily collect sleep data and receive personalized health information. Sleep management applications using this help promote healthy lifestyles for users.

## Introduction
Sleep is an important physiological process that greatly affects our health and quality of life. Bad sleep quality can be associated with stress, depression, anxiety, excessive fatigue, poor concentration, and physical health problems. Therefore, it is very important to measure and improve the quality of sleep. Against this backdrop, it is important to understand the relationship between sleep quality and brain waves and to create applications that help correct sleep patterns. In fact, we found several sleep diary writing platforms for people suffering from sleep disorders. But most of the applications came in a rigid format, and there were even applications that provided only a role as a diary without even the ability to analyze sleep. 
We wanted to create a systematic sleep analysis and an application that helps users keep writing their sleep diaries without getting bored. So, We used Image creation AI and Brid.zzz to make this happen.
LG electronic released Brid.zzz for user's mental care and sleep care. Brid.zzz recognizes the brain waves when the user sleeps and provides an analysis of them. We will ask the image-generating AI to provide relevant images by combining this data with the qualitative data entered by the user. When the picture is created, the user can receive the sleep state as a visual image rather than a text, which stimulates the visual and makes it more interesting than before to write a sleep diary.
